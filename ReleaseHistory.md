# Release History

## Release notes for version 0.1 (29th November, 2016)

In this first release of this diary, we have tried our best to keep it bug free as far as possible. Features are as follows.

### Features

- This release will be compatible with all the later releases. That means, any entry created with this release will be available and usable in later releases
- Google Drive is supported as the only storage provider. User need to give the [permission for application data folder](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/appdata). [More details](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/web/scopes)
- Multiple entries for a date is possible
- Entries for future date is possible
- Buttons for **Bold** & *Italics* are available in the editor. As we are using [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) compatible renderer, all the tags available for `CommonMark` will be available for the writing. [reference](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/)
- Entries would be automatically saved with a delay of 2 seconds after last change (so, there would be no impact over the limitation of Google drive api calls per second)

### Disclaimer

- We have only manually tested this application. Unit tests and automated end-to-end tests have not been added in this release. Those are planned for future releases
- Refresh on the editor is not permitted and will show one `404 error` generated by GitHub
- This release is only for Google Chrome Desktop version. Best viewed at a minimum `1024px by 768px` view-port. But it should work flawlessly with Firefox and Safari
